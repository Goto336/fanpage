                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Uncharted is a third person action adventure game that has a series of six games so far, but leaving "<strong>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</strong>" the final chapter of Nathan Drake's story. In Uncharted, you play as Nathan Drake who is a treasure hunter who goes on many adventures to find the greatest treasures out there. But, these adventures end up leading him and his friends into trouble as they have to fight against tyrants leading from mafias to vicious war generals and their army, and eventually an old friend turned psycho.</p>
                
                <p>Uncharted has one of the best story telling shown in any video game. For it's not just about going out to dangerous places finding treasure and shooting people. The story gets you connected to each charater and it makes you want to keep playing to see how it all ends</p>
                
                <p>Along with the story and the crazy shooting, the game also has challenging puzzles to solve inorder to get to the next area, and has a lot of climbing.</p>
                
                <p>The game even features it's on multiplayer for players to go head to head against each other in game modes like "Team Deathmatch", "King of the Hill", "Bounty Hunt", "Command", "Plunder", and "Classic" (Only in Uncharted 4). Plus the game has "Survival" mode, which is a game mode where 3-4 players play together and survive against wave after waves of enemies eventually leading up to boss battles or as the game calls it "Warloads".</p>
                
                <p>Below you see a few of my favorite charater and descriptions about them.</p>
